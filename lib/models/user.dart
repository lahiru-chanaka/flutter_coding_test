/// Immutable data model representing a user.
///
/// - All fields are `final`, making the class immutable and thread-safe.
/// - Includes a [fromJson] factory constructor for easy deserialization from JSON responses.
/// - Provides null safety and default fallbacks (e.g. 'N/A') to prevent runtime errors from missing fields.
/// - Overrides [==] and [hashCode] for value equalityâ€”essential when using collections or state management.
/// - Overrides [toString] for easier debugging and logging.
///
/// - Avoid using `as Type` directly unless the source is trusted; use type checking when parsing untrusted JSON.
/// - If optional fields are expected, make the corresponding fields nullable instead of defaulting silently.
